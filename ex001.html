        <h1>HTML basics</h1>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its
            content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted
            points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic
            understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
        <h5>So what is HTML?</h5>
        <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series
            of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a
            certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to
            somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For
            example, take the following line of content:
        </p>
        <h5>My cat is very grumpy</h5>
        <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
            paragraph tags:</p>
        <div class="container">
            <h6> <kbd>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grump&lt;/p&gt;</kbd></h6>
        </div> <br>
        <h5>Anatomy of an HTML element</h5>
        <p>Let´s explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
       <div class="container"><img src="/images/print1.jpeg"></div>  <br> 
        <h5>The main parts of our element are as follows:</h5>
        <div class="container">
            <ol>
                <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in
                    opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take
                    effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
                <hr>

                <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward
                    slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the
                    paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can
                    lead to strange results.</li>
                <hr>

                <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                <hr>

                <li> The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the
                    element.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <h5>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</h5>
        <img src="/images/print2.jpeg"> <br> <br>
        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual
            content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value.
            The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to
            target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other
            things.</p>
        <h5>An attribute should always have the following:</h5>
        <div class="container">
            <ol>
                <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already
                    has one or more attributes).</li>
                <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign</li>
                <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li> <br>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>Note: Simple attribute values that don't contain ASCII whitespace (or any of the
                        characters <strong><code>" ' ` = &lt; > </code></strong>) can remain unquoted, but it is recommended that you
                        quote all attribute values, as it makes the code more consistent and understandable.</p>
                </div>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <h5>Nesting elements</h5>
        <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state
            that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <u><strong>&lt;strong &gt;</strong></u> element, which
            means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
            <p>
               <kbd>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong &gt;very&lt;/strong &gt; grumpy. &lt;/p&gt;</kbd> 
            </p>
            <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example
                above, we opened the <u><strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong></u> element first, then the <u><strong>&lt;strong &gt;</strong></u> 
                element; therefore, we have to close the <u><strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong></u> element first, then the  <u><strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong></u>
                element. The following is incorrect:
            </p>
            <div class="container">
            <p><kbd>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</kbd></p>
            </div>
    </div>
