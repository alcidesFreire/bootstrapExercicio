        <h1>HTML basics</h1>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its
            content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted
            points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic
            understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
        <h5>So what is HTML?</h5>
        <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series
            of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a
            certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to
            somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For
            example, take the following line of content:
        </p>
        <h5>My cat is very grumpy</h5>
        <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
            paragraph tags:</p>
        <div class="container">
            <h6> <kbd>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grump&lt;/p&gt;</kbd></h6>
        </div> <br>
        <h5>Anatomy of an HTML element</h5>
        <p>Let´s explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
        <div class="container">
            <img src="/images/print1.jpeg">
        </div> <br>
        <h5>The main parts of our element are as follows:</h5>
        <div class="container">
            <ol>
                <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in
                    opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take
                    effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
                <hr>

                <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward
                    slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the
                    paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can
                    lead to strange results.</li>
                <hr>

                <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                <hr>

                <li> The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the
                    element.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <h5>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</h5>
        <img src="/images/print2.jpeg"> <br> <br>
        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual
            content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value.
            The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to
            target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other
            things.</p>
        <h5>An attribute should always have the following:</h5>
        <div class="container">
            <ol>
                <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already
                    has one or more attributes).</li>
                <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign</li>
                <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li> <br>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>Note: Simple attribute values that don't contain ASCII whitespace (or any of the
                        characters <strong><code>" ' ` = &lt; > </code></strong>) can remain unquoted, but it is
                        recommended that you
                        quote all attribute values, as it makes the code more consistent and understandable.</p>
                </div>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <h5>Nesting elements</h5>
        <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state
            that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <u><strong>&lt;strong &gt;</strong></u>
            element, which
            means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
        <p>
            <kbd>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong &gt;very&lt;/strong &gt; grumpy. &lt;/p&gt;</kbd>
        </p>
        <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example
            above, we opened the <u><strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong></u> element first, then the <u><strong>&lt;strong
                    &gt;</strong></u>
            element; therefore, we have to close the <u><strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong></u> element first, then the
            <u><strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong></u>
            element. The following is incorrect:
        </p>
        <div class="container">
            <p><kbd>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</kbd></p>
        </div>
        <p>The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one
            another. If they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at
            what you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So <strong>don't do it!</strong></p>
        <h5>Empty elements</h5>
        <p>Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the <u><strong>&lt;img&gt;</strong> </u>
            element that we already have in our HTML page:</p>
        <div class="container">
            <p> <kbd>&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;</kbd></p>
        </div>
        <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing <strong>&lt;/img&gt;</strong> tag and no inner content.
            This is
            because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in
            the HTML page in the place it appears.</p>
        <h5>Anatomy of an HTML document</h5>
        <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now
            we'll look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the
            code we put into our index.html example (which we first met in the <u>Dealing with files</u> article):</p>
        <div class="container"><img src="/images/header-html.jpeg"></div> <br>
        <h5>Here, we have the following:</h5>
        <div class="container">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong> — doctype. It is a required preamble. In the mists of time,
                    when HTML
                    was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the
                    HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error
                    checking and other useful things. However these days, they don't do much and are basically
                    just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for
                    now</li> <br>
                <li><strong>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</strong> — the &lt;html&gt; element. This element wraps all the
                    content on the entire
                    page and is sometimes known as the root element.</li> <br>
                <li><strong>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</strong>the &lt;head&gt; element. This element acts as a container
                    for all the stuff
                    you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's
                    viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in
                    search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</li> <br>
                <li><strong>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</strong> — This element sets the character set your document
                    should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages.
                    Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not
                    to set this and it can help avoid some problems later on.</li> <br>
                <li><strong>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</strong>— the &lt;title&gt; element. This sets the title of your
                    page, which is the
                    title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the
                    page when you bookmark/favorite it.</li> <br>
                <li><strong>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</strong>— the &lt;body&gt; element. This contains all the content
                    that you want to
                    show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games,
                    playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</li>
            </ul>
