        <h1>HTML basics</h1>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its
            content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted
            points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic
            understanding of HTML and its functions.</p>
            <h5>So what is HTML?</h5>
            <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series
                of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a
                certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to
                somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For
                example, take the following line of content:
                </p>
                <h5>My cat is very grumpy</h5>
                <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
                    paragraph tags:</p>
                    <h5>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grump&lt;/p&gt;</h5>
    </div>
</body>
